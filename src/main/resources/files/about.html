<h1>About Covivax</h1>
<p>Covivax is an open-source, proof-of-concept application developed for the University of Michigan Honors 240: Wellness final project. Developed with Kotlin and Ktor, the application is designed for families to report vaccinations for household members. Because it is a proof-of-concept, data is not stored in a database and is intended for short-term use only. (Data is stored on memory.) While a database can be configured, my coding is not advanced enough to add security features.</p>
